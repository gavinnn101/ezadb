* Add that folder to your environment variables. [Tutorial on how to do this](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Adding-folder-path-to-Windows-PATH-environment-variable.html)
* Open up terminal / powershell / command prompt
* * Run `ezadb` which should print the availble commands, etc.

* Did you get `ezadb is not recognized as an internal or external command`?
* * Something is wrong with how you setup your path to `ezadb` in your environment variables.
